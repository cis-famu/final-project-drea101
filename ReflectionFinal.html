            <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
            <p>What I learned about this class is how organized you have to be to code. It's a lot of different compartments to coding. I learned that you have to take coding one piece at a time to stay on the write track. Also, I learned that basic principles can not be skipped over or it will effect the outcoome of your coding. I also learned that working in groups is a essential skill to learn if entering a career in the computer science field. Working in groups have really helped my interpersonal skills. </p>

            <h2>What I Found Intersting</h2>
            <p>What I found most interesting about the things I learned in this class is simply learning how to make a website. I was very proud of myself when I learned how to link several HTML pages to a navigation page and it reminded me of how I didn't know all things that went into one. </p>

            <h2>What I Stuggled With</h2>
            <p>What I struggle with most was figuring out CSS. What I found most confusing was how to assign different things to a certain CSS. When coding I found myself confused with assigning different codes to certain classes so that the CSS would alter them.  </p>
